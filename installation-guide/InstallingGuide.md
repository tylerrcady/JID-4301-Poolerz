# Poolerz Installation Guide
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.
## üìã Requirements
- **MongoDB** ‚Äì To access Poolerz data, your email must be whitelisted in the database.
- **Node.js & React** ‚Äì If you‚Äôve never used React or Node.js, download and install the latest LTS version from:  [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## ‚ö° Installation
### Downloading Node.js
For users that have never used React, they can install the latest version of Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/

### Cloning Github Repository
1. Navigate to your desired directory in the terminal (where you want the project to live).
2. Run the following command to clone this repo:

   ```
      git clone https://github.com/tylerrcady/JID-4301-Poolerz.git
   ```
3. Open the cloned folder (`JID-4301-Poolerz`) in your preferred code editor.

### Adding Environment Variable File
For the next steps, you will create a local environment file that will contain the API and authentication keys necessary to run the application.

4. Navigate into the `my-app` directory:

   ```
   cd my-app
   ```
5. Create a file called `.env.local` in this directory and populate it with the following content:

   ```
   AUTH_SECRET=<insert AUTH_SECRET key>
   AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=<insert AUTH_GOOGLE_ID key>
   AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=<insert AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET key>
   AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   MONGODB_URI=<insert MONGODB_URI key>
   JWT_SECRET=<insert JWT_SECRET key>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<insert NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY>
   ```

### Running application locally
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Always make sure you're inside the `my-app` directory before running the below commands.

6. Install dependencies (only required the first time or when dependencies are updated):

   ```
       npm install
   ```
7. Start the development server:

   ```
       npm run dev
   ```
## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you run into issues starting the app, check the following common causes:

   1. **Not in the correct directory**  
   Make sure you're inside the `my-app` folder before running any commands regarding running the application.

   2. **Dependencies not installed or out-of-date**  
If you see module-related errors (e.g. `module not found`, `cannot resolve`), try reinstalling dependencies using the following command in `my-app`:
      ```
      npm install
      ```

   3. **Missing or incorrect API keys**  
Some features depend on environment variables (e.g., API keys). Ensure your `.env.local` file is present and correctly configured.  
Double-check for:

      - Missing variables
      - Typos in variable names
      - Misplaced quotation marks or trailing spaces

4. **Port already in use**  
If you get an error like `EADDRINUSE`, another app may already be running on the default port (3000). You can kill the process or run the app on a different port:
   ```
   npm run dev -- --port=3001
   ```

   If the issue persists, try restarting your terminal, and do a clean reinstall in `my-app` using:
      ```
      rm -rf node_modules
      npm install
      ```
