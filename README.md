# Poolerz - Carpooling Application
Poolerz is a web-based carpooling application designed to support busy professionals with children between the ages of 7 and 15 who attend camps, schools, or clubs with no transportation option. Carpooling among parents is the preferred solution, but some parents may not have a strong network or may not know any other parents and have a limited opportunity to connect. For parents who are connected, carpooling is complex and complicated and requires the exchange of a lot of information, such as capacity, availability, constraints, proximity, and more. It's a logistical challenge. At Poolerz, we strive to solve all of these problems.
